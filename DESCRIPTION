Description: Interfacing to Nocedal et al. L-BFGS-B.3.0 (2011) limited
	memory BFGS minimizer with bounds on parameters. This is a fork of lbfgsb3.  This
	registers a R compatible c interface to lbfgsb3 that uses the same function types
	and optimization as the optim library (see writing R extensions for details).
